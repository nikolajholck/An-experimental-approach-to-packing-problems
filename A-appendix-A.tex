\section{Three-dimensional universal packings}\label{appendix-A}
\noindent Here we present all of the 21 three-dimensional unique universal packings. They have been produced using the dimension tuple $\paren{4, 5, 6}$. The 4-by-5, 4-by-6 and 5-by-6 rectangles are colored red, green and blue, respectively.
