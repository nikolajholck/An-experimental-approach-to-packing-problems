\section{Four-dimensional universal packing}\label{appendix-B}
\noindent Here we present all of the squares of a four-dimensional universal packing. The packing has been produced using the dimension tuple $\paren{8, 9, 10, 12}$. The 8-by-9, 8-by-10, 8-by-12, 9-by-10, 9-by-12 and 10-by-12 rectangles are colored red, green, blue, orange, yellow and violet, respectively.
